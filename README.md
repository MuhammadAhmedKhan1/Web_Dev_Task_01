<h1> HTML Resume Project</h1>

<p>This repository contains my first assignment for learning HTML, where I created a basic resume webpage using HTML tags like headings, paragraphs, bold, italic, and underline.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>In this project, I developed a simple resume layout using core HTML elements. This project focuses on:</p>

<p>- Creating a structured document using headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.).
- Using paragraphs (`<p>`) for text content.
- Applying text styling with:
  - **Bold** (`<b>`)
  - *Italic* (`<i>`)
  - Underline (`<u>`)

This project serves as a foundational exercise in HTML and demonstrates how basic HTML tags can be used to create a straightforward resume layout.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>- Heading Tags: Organized sections of the resume, like name, contact information, work experience, and education.
- Paragraphs: Descriptive information within each section.
- Text Styling: Enhanced readability by highlighting important text using bold, italic, and underline.</p>
